Anno 2205
Revolutions Mod English Translated v1.0 by Geniuswas

Based on original mod:
Revolutions Mod "Universus" v1.8 by Annothek
https://www.annothek.net/wbb5/filebase/index.php?file/120-revolution-mod-universus-v-1-8/

This is an English translation of the above mod. All rights reserved to the original mod creator. After a few years of inactivity, and with recent exposure thanks to content creators such as Nivarias, I have reuploaded the mod properly onto git.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Download release and extract zip folder. Move 'data' folder into the Anno 2205 installation folder, this folder should not overwrite anything. Works with Steam and Uplay versions.
2. Run Anno 2205 at least once (if you haven't done so already). This is to generate the config folders in your Documents.
3. In C:\Users\[YOURUSER]\Documents\Anno 2205\config, open engine.ini with notepad or similar.
4. The third entry,  "PreferLocalFiles": false   change to "PreferLocalFiles": true . This tells the engine to load the 'data' folder you just installed instead of loading the core installation folders.
5. Run the game, if you are greeted with the new startup loading screen with "Revolutions mod" text then installation is successful. Enjoy!

MODDING

You can mod the building settings yourself by editing the respective .xml files. Recommended to use Notepad++.

WHAT IS REVOLUTIONS MOD?

The original mod was hosted on the German Annothek forums which has since been closed. The original 'Revolutions' is a general expansion and tweak of Anno 2205 with new resources and their respective production chains (from non-utilised official assets datamined from game files), new pool of sector effects, new buildings and ornaments (as well as changes to their unlockability), rework of the Orbital DLC, flavour additions for all sectors and DLCs, as well as a host of balancing tweaks. 

On top of the base mod, some changes were made in the English version:
