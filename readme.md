INSTRUCTIONS
1. Download release and extract zip folder. Move 'data' folder into Anno 2205 installation folder, this folder should not overwrite anything.
2. Run Anno 2205 at least once (if you haven't done so already). This is to generate the config folders in your Documents.
3. In C:\Users\[YOURUSER]\Documents\Anno 2205\config, open engine.ini with notepad or similar.
4. The third entry,  "PreferLocalFiles": false   change to "PreferLocalFiles": true . This tells the engine to load the 'data' folder you just installed instead of loading the core installation folders.
5. Run the game, if you are greeted with the new startup loading screen with "Revolutions mod" text then installation is successful. Enjoy!

MODDING

You can mod the building settings yourself by editing the respective .xml files. Recommended to use Notepad++.
